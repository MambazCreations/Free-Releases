Loan Sharking Script for FiveM
📌 Description
This is a Loan Sharking script for FiveM that allows players to take loans from a Loan Shark NPC, repay loans with interest, and face consequences if loans are not repaid on time. The script includes configurable settings for interest rates, loan limits, repayment times, and NPC behavior for missed payments.

This script uses:

ox_lib – for UI and notifications
ox_target – for interaction with the Loan Shark NPC
qb-core – for handling player data and money
oxmysql – for managing loan data in the database
